This function facilitates comprehensive management of the movie selection process for theaters. It enables the movie manager to add, update, and remove movies, ensuring accurate and current information in the database. Additionally, the manager can schedule showtimes without overlaps and remove them post-screening. Users can easily view ongoing and upcoming movies, categorized by genre, and search for specific titles. The system also generates movie analysis reports for informed decision-making.
